### Site Birthday

A little js script that displays a banner on your site when it's your site's birthday!

### Setup

Include this file at the **bottom** of your HTML code, before the closing `</body>` tag.
* Alternatively, you can wrap it in `$(document).ready()`

### TODO:

* Wrap this in a function so it can be called with configurations
* Mobile-friendliness
